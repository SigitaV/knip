		<intro>
			This node allows the user to manually add to, remove from, and modify
			existing labelings. In order to modify an existing label, first
			select the label you wish to add or remove from the list of available
			labels. Then simply click on existing labels in the image view to
			change them. Clicking with the left mouse button adds the selected
			label to the region whereas clicking with the right mouse button
			removes them.
			<br />
			The labels present in the image are organized in two lists - one for
			 newly created labels and one for labels already existing in the laoded image. 
			 New labels can be created, renamed or deleted freely, affecting all occurrences in the input.
