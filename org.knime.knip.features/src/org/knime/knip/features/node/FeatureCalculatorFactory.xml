			Calculate numerical features of an image, the regions
			in a labeling (= segments) or segment on an image.

		<tab name = "Feature Set Configuration">
				<option name="Select Image Column">
					Select the image column on which 
					the features should be computed.
				</option>
				<option name="Select Labeling Column">
					Select the labeling column on 
					which the features should be computed.
				</option>
				<option name="Column Creation Mode">
					Mode how to handle the selected 
					columns. The processed columns can be added to a new table or 
					appended to the end of the input table.
				</option>
			
				<option name = "Dimensions">
					Select the dimensions on which the selected 
					feature sets should be computed. If the input has three dimensions 
					but only two dimensions are selected the node will slice the input 
					and compute the features on the two dimensional slices.
				</option>
			
				<option name = "Add">
					Select the feature set to compute and add it with
					the "Add" button to the "Selected Feature Sets" - Panel. 
					<br></br>
					You can add as many feature sets as you want. If you add feature sets 
					which are not compatible with the input columns or the selected dimensions 
					the node will skip the feature set during execution. 
				</option>

			<option name = "Selected Feature Sets">
				Some of the feature sets can be configured. You can select the features 
				which should be computed or enter other parameters for the feature computation.
			</option> 
		</tab>
		
		<tab name = "Label Segment Settings">
			<option name = "Append labels of overlapping segments">
				If true, the labels of overlapping segments will be appended in an 
				additional column (';'-separated).
			</option>
			<option name = "Overlapping segments do NOT need to completely overlap">
				If selected, segments will also be counted as overlapping, if so don't 
				overlap completely.
			</option>
			<option name = "Append segment information">
				If selected, the bitmask and the label of each segment will be added.
			</option>
			<option name = "Segment Label Filter">
				Only labels which hold the given regular expression are considered during 
				the calculation.
			</option>
