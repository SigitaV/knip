	<shortDescription>
		Voronoi based segmentation
    </shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Performs a Voronoi based segmentation of images. Requires
			an
			input table with a source image and a labeling of the corresponding
			seed regions.
    </intro>

		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Image to work on">
				Select the column that contains the full image of
				the cells.
    </option>
			<option name="Seed regions image">
				Select the column that contains image with the
				seed regions.
    </option>
			<option name="Background threshold value">
				If a pixel value is less than this value it is
				considered being
				background
				and is not part of any cell.
    </option>
			<option name="Fill holes">Fills holes within segments of the same label in
				a
				post-processing step.</option>
			<option name="Result column">Appends either a column with the complete voronoi
				based segmentation, the voronoi segmentation without the seeds or
				both.</option>
	<option name="Dimension selection">
	This component allows the selection of dimensions of interest. If an algorithm cannot, as it only supports fewer dimensions than the number of dimensions of the image, or shouldnot, as one wants to run the algorithm only on subsets of the image, be applied on the complete image, the dimension selection can be used to define the plane/cube/hypercube on which the algorithm is applied. Example 1 with three dimensional Image (X,Y,Time): An algorithm cannot be applied to the complete image, as it only supports two dimensional images. If you select e.g. X,Y then the algorithm will be applied to all X,Y planes individually. Example 2 with three dimensional Image (X,Y,Time): The algorithm can be applied in two, three or even more dimensions. Select the dimensions to define your plane/cube/hypercube on which the algorithm will be applied.
