	<name>Image Segment Features</name>
	<shortDescription>Calculates features of images under consideration of
		the given labeling</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Calculate features of an image under consideration of a given
			labeling. e.g.: Calculate each selected feature for each individual
			segment.

		</intro>

		<tab name="Features">
			<option name="Tamura">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Calculates 6 Tamura features: Granularity, Contrast, Kurtosis
						of Directionality
						Standard Deviation of Directionality, Maximal
						directionality, Skewness
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>

			<option name="Segment Geometry">
				<ul>
					<li>Basic geometric properties: e.g. size,
						perimeter, centroid,
						circulartiy, convexity, diameter, ...
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>

			<option name="First order statistics">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Calculates the moments of the first
						order statistics. The
						following features are computed: Min, Max, Mean,
						Geometric Mean,
						Sum,
						Square of Sums, Standard Deviation, Variance,
						Skewness,
						Kurtosis,
						Quantil25, Quantil50, Quantil75, user defined Quantil,
						Histogram.
						Please note that
						the Geometric Mean
						can only be computed
						on unsigned
						datatypes.
						Invalid
						calculations
						(i.e. NaN) result in
						missing cells.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>

			<option name="Haralick">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Statistical features based on gray-level co-occurrence matrix.
						Rotation invariance
						can be reached by averaging over the four
						directional co-occurrence matrices
						(activate 'compute average').
						See
						http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/publications/boland/boland_node26.html
						for more information.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
		</tab>

		<tab name="Region of Interest Settings">
			<option name="Append non ROI labels?">
				If true, non ROI labels will be appended
			</option>
			<option name="Non ROI Labels must Completely Overlap with ROI?">
				If selected, regions will also be counted as
				overlapping, if so don't
				overlap completely.
			</option>
			<option name="Append ROI Information">If selected, additional information of each
				region of interest will be add (e.g. bitmask, source labeling,
				label). Useful, e.g., if the resulting segment table should be
				composed again to a labeling (e.g. using the GroupBy-node).
			</option>
			<option name="Filter Labels">
				<ul>
					<li> Filter ROIs: Only labels which hold
						the given rule considered
						during the calculation
					</li>
					<li>Filtering non ROIs: Only labels which hold the
						will be put into
						the non ROI list.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
			<option name="Intersection Mode">
				<ul>
					<li> Disabled: Only labels which always appear together are
						considered to have a dependency
					</li>
					<li> Enabled: Labels which at least appear one time together are
						considered to have a dependency
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
