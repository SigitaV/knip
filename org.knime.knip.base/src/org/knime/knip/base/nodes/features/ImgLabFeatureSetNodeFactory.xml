	<name>Image Segment Features</name>
	<shortDescription>Calculates features of images under consideration of
		the given labeling</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Calculate features of an image under consideration of a given
			labeling. e.g.: Calculate each selected feature for each individual
			segment.

		</intro>

		<tab name="Features">
			<option name="Tamura">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Calculates 6 Tamura features: Granularity, Contrast, Kurtosis
						of Directionality
						Standard Deviation of Directionality, Maximal
						directionality, Skewness
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>

			<option name="Segment Geometry">
				<ul>
					<li>Basic geometric properties: e.g. size,
						perimeter, centroid,
						circulartiy, convexity, diameter, ...
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>

			<option name="First order statistics">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Calculates the moments of the first
						order statistics. The
						following features are computed: Min, Max, Mean,
						Geometric Mean,
						Sum,
						Square of Sums, Standard Deviation, Variance,
						Skewness,
						Kurtosis,
						Quantil25, Quantil50, Quantil75, user defined Quantil,
						Histogram.
						Please note that
						the Geometric Mean
						can only be computed
						on unsigned
						datatypes.
						Invalid
						calculations
						(i.e. NaN) result in
						missing cells.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>

			<option name="Haralick">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Statistical features based on gray-level co-occurrence matrix.
						Rotation invariance
						can be reached by averaging over the four
						directional co-occurrence matrices
						(activate 'compute average').
						See
						http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/publications/boland/boland_node26.html
						for more information.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
		</tab>

		<tab name="Segment Settings">
			<option name="Append labels of overlapping segments">
				If true, the labels of overlapping segments will
				be appended in an additional column (';'-separated).
			</option>
			<option name="Overlapping segments do NOT need to completely overlap">
				If selected, segments will also be counted as
				overlapping, if so don't
				overlap completely.
			</option>
			<option name="Append segment information">If selected, additional information of each
				segment will be add (e.g. bitmask, source labeling,
				label). Useful,
				e.g., if the resulting segment table should be
				composed again to a
				labeling (e.g. using the GroupBy-node).
			</option>
			<option name="Filter on segment labels">
				Only labels which hold
				the given rule considered
				during the calculation.
			</option>
			<option name="Filter overlapping segment labels">
				Only the labels that comply with the specified
				rules will appear in the list of overlapping labels.
			</option>
