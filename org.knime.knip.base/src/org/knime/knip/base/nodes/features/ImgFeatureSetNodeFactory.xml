		<option name="Tamura">
			<ul>
					<li>
						Calculates 6 Tamura features: Granularity, Contrast, Kurtosis of Directionality
						Standard Deviation of Directionality, Maximal directionality, Skewness
					</li>
					</ul>
		</option>
		
		<option name="First order statistics">
			<ul>
					<li>
						Calculates the moments of the first
						order statistics. The
						following features are computed: Min, Max, Mean,
						Geometric Mean, Sum,
						Square of Sums, Standard Deviation, Variance,
						Skewness, Kurtosis,
						Quantil25, Quantil50, Quantil75, user defined Quantil, Histogram.
						Please note that
						the Geometric Mean
						can only be computed on unsigned
						datatypes.
						Invalid
						calculations
						(i.e. NaN) result in missing cells.</li>
			</ul>
		</option>
		
		<option name="Haralick">
		<ul>
					<li>
						Statistical features based on gray-level co-occurrence matrix. Rotation invariance
						can be reached by averaging over the four directional co-occurrence matrices
						(activate 'compute average').
						See http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/publications/boland/boland_node26.html
						for more information.</li>
