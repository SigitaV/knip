	<shortDescription>Calculates features of segments using labelings</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Calculate features of an image under consideration of a given
			labeling. e.g.: Calculate each selected feature for each individual
			segment.
		</intro>

		<tab name="Features">
			<option name="Segment Geometry">
				<ul>
					<li>Basic geometric properties: e.g. size,
						perimeter, centroid,
						circulartiy, convexity, diameter, ...
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>

			<option name="Shape Descriptors">
				<ul>
					<li>Centroid Distance:
						The distance from the
						centroid to
						the outline
						of this segment.
					</li>
					<li>
						FD Centroid Distance:
						The distances from the
						centroid to the
						contour in fourier space. From the resulting
						fourier coefficients
						the magnitude is taken and their are
						normalized by the first
						component (cp. Fourier Descriptors).
						Please note that only (n/2)-1
						features will be calculated (where n is the number
						of contour
						points). The number of samples must be a power of 2.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
		</tab>

		<tab name="Region of Interest Settings">
			<option name="Append non ROI labels?">
				If true, non ROI labels will be appended
			</option>
			<option name="Non ROI Labels must Completely Overlap with ROI?">
				If selected, regions will also be counted as
				overlapping, if so don't
				overlap completely.
			</option>
			<option name="Append ROI Information">If selected, additional information of each
				region of interest will be add (e.g. bitmask, source labeling,
				label). Useful, e.g., if the resulting segment table should be
				composed again to a labeling (e.g. using the GroupBy-node).
			</option>
			<option name="Filter Labels">
				<ul>
					<li> Filter ROIs: Only labels which hold
						the given rule considered
						during the calculation
					</li>
					<li>Filtering non ROIs: Only labels which hold the
						will be put into
						the non ROI list.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
			<option name="Intersection Mode">
				<ul>
					<li> Disabled: Only labels which always appear together are
						considered to have a dependency
					</li>
					<li> Enabled: Labels which at least appear one time together are
						considered to have a dependency
					</li>
				</ul>
