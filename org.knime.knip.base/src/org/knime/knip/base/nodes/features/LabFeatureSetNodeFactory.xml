	<name>Segment Features</name>
	<shortDescription>Calculates features of segments using labelings</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Calculate features of an image under consideration of a given
			labeling. e.g.: Calculate each selected feature for each individual
			segment.
		</intro>

		<tab name="Features">
			<option name="Segment Geometry">
				<ul>
					<li>Basic geometric properties: e.g. size,
						perimeter, centroid,
						circulartiy, convexity, diameter, ...
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>

			<option name="Shape Descriptors">
				<ul>
					<li>Centroid Distance:
						The distance from the
						centroid to
						the outline
						of this segment.
					</li>
					<li>
						FD Centroid Distance:
						The distances from the
						centroid to the
						contour in fourier space. From the resulting
						fourier coefficients
						the magnitude is taken and their are
						normalized by the first
						component (cp. Fourier Descriptors).
						Please note that only (n/2)-1
						features will be calculated (where n is the number
						of contour
						points). The number of samples must be a power of 2.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>
		</tab>

		<tab name="Segment Settings">
			<option name="Append labels of overlapping segments">
				If true, the labels of overlapping segments will
				be appended in an additional column (';'-separated).
			</option>
			<option name="Overlapping segments do NOT need to completely overlap">
				If selected, segments will also be counted as
				overlapping, if so don't
				overlap completely.
			</option>
			<option name="Append segment information">If selected, additional information of each
				segment will be add (e.g. bitmask, source labeling,
				label). Useful,
				e.g., if the resulting segment table should be
				composed again to a
				labeling (e.g. using the GroupBy-node).
			</option>
			<option name="Filter on segment labels">
				Only labels which hold
				the given rule considered
				during the calculation.
			</option>
			<option name="Filter overlapping segment labels">
				Only the labels that comply with the specified
				rules will appear in the list of overlapping labels.
			</option>
