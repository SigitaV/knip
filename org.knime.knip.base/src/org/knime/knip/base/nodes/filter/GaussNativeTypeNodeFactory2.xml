	<fullDescription>
		<intro>A Gaussian blur (also known as Gaussian smoothing) is the
			result of blurring an image by a Gaussian function. It is a widely
			used effect in graphics software, typically to reduce image noise and
			reduce detail. The visual effect of this blurring technique is a
			smooth blur resembling that of viewing the image through a
			translucent screen, distinctly different from the bokeh effect
			produced by an out-of-focus lens or the shadow of an object under
			usual illumination. Gaussian smoothing is also used as a
			pre-processing stage in computer vision algorithms in order to
			enhance image structures at different scalesâ€”see scale space
			representation and scale space implementation (from
			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur).

				seperate the values with commas). If only a single value is given,
				it will be used for each dimension. If multiple sigmas are given,
				the number of sigmas must match the number of selected dimensions.
