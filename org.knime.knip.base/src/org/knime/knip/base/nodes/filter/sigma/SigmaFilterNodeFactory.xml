	<shortDescription>
		Applies sigma filtering to the input images.

		<intro>
			This filter is based on the algorithm described in the
			following paper:

			Lee, Jong-Sen (1983), "Digital image smoothing and
			the sigma filter",
			Computer vision, graphics, and image processing 24
			(2): 255-269,
			CODEN: CVGPDB, ISSN 0734-189X

			From the website:

			"The
			filter smooths an image by taking an average over the neighboring
			pixels, but only includes those pixels that have a value not
			deviating from the current pixel by more than a given range. The
			range is defined by the standard deviation of the pixel values within
			the neighborhood ("Use Pixels Within ... Sigmas").

			If the number of
			pixels in this range is too low (less than "Minimum
			Pixel Fraction"),
			averaging over all neighboring pixels is performed.
			With the "Outlier
			Aware" option, averaging over all neighboring
			pixels excludes the
			center pixel. Thus, outliers having a value very
			different from the
			surrounding are not included in the average and,
			thus, completely
			eliminated." (detail see: http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Sigma_Filter)

		<tab name="options">
			<option name="Span">The Window Span parameter determines the span of
				the window in one direction. The resulting window size is given by:
				span*2+1 in each dimension.
			</option>
			<option name="Sigma Factor">Factor to scale sigma. It
				modifies the size of the
				interval.
			</option>
			<option name="Pixel Fraction">The minimum fraction of pixels which have to be
				in range. Otherwise the mean of all values inside the window is
				calculated.
			</option>
			<option name="Outlier Detection">Extends the option "Pixel Fraction" by leaving
				out the center pixel if the fraction of pixels is below the minimum.
			</option>
