		Applies the Sobel-Operator to the input images. Use
		signed image types (like byte, short, etc) to avoid unwanted image

		<intro>
			The Sobel operator is used in image processing,
			particularly
			within edge detection algorithms. Technically, it is a
			discrete
			differentiation operator, computing an approximation of the
			gradient
			of the image intensity function. At each point in the image,
			the
			result of the Sobel operator is either the corresponding gradient
			vector or the normof this vector. The Sobel operator is based on
			convolving the image with a small, separable, and integer valued
			filter in horizontal
			and vertical direction and is therefore
			relatively inexpensive in
			terms of computations. On the other hand,
			the gradient approximation
			which it produces is relatively crude, in
			particular for high
			frequency variations in the image (see:
			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator).
