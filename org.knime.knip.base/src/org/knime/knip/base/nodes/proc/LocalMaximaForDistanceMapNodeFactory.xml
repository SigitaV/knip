	<name>Local Maxima for Distance Map</name>
	<shortDescription>
		Optimized computation of local maxima if the input
		image is a distance map (see: Distance Map node in KNIME).
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node computes the local pixel maxima (given some
			neighborhood) given
			a distance map. As we know that the input is a
			distance map, the algorithm is optimized in runtime. For any other
			type of input image, e.g. arbitrary images, use the Maximum Finder.
		</intro>
		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Connected Type">Type of the neighborhood. Eight-Connected means
				that the eight pixels around a maximum candidate are considered
				during computation. Sixteen makes this neighborhood one pixel larger
				etc.
