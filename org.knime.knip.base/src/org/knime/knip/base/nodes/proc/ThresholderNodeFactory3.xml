		A threshold is determined manually or calculated
		automatically to threshold the image.

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			A threshold algorithms automatically (or manually) determines a
			threshold to distinguish between foreground and background of an
			image. After the threshold has been computed or manually chosen
			selected, the algorithm marks any pixel with an intensity value
			greater than this threshold with "1" and any pixel with intensity
			lower than the threshold as "0". The result is a binary image which
			subsequently can be processed with the Connected Component Analysis
			Node to extract a labeling with separated segments.

			For details see:
			<i>"Survey over image thresholding techniques and quantitative
				performance evaluation" (Sezgin04)</i>
