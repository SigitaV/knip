		<intro>
			Adaptive histogram equalization (AHE) is a computer image processing
			technique used to improve contrast in images. Contrast Limited AHE
			(CLAHE) was developed prevent the over amplification of noise. For
			more information see
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_histogram_equalization">Wikipedia</a>
		</intro>
		<tab name="Options">
			<option name="Blocksize"> The size of the local region around a pixel for
				which the histogram is equalized. This size should be larger than
				the size of features to be preserved.</option>
			<option name="Number of Bins"> The amount of different pixel values which are
				used for the histogram equalization.</option>
			<option name="Slope"> Limits the contrast stretch in the intensity
				transfer function. Very large values will let the histogram
				equalization do whatever it wants to do, that is result in maximal
				local contrast. The value 1 will result in the original image.
			</option>
