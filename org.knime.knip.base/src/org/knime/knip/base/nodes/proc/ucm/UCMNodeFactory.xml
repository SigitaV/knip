		<intro>
			UCMs are a extraction system that combines several types of
			low-level image information into a generic notion of segmentation
			scale. This system constructs a hierarchical representation of the
			image boundaries called Ultrametric Contour Map (UCM). Thresholding
			the resulting UCM (e.g. with a Global Thresholder) with some
			threshold k provides by definition a set of closed curves, the
			boundaries of the segmentation at scale k (from
			http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~arbelaez/UCM.html).
