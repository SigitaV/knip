		<intro>
			UCMs are a extraction system that combines several types of low-level image information into a 
			generic notion of segmentation scale. This system constructs a hierarchical representation of the 
			image boundaries called Ultrametric Contour Map (UCM). Thresholding an UCM at level k provides 
			by definition a set of closed curves, the boundaries of the segmentation at scale k. 
			(from http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~arbelaez/UCM.html).
